# @hashgraph/hedera-wallet-snap

This repository contains code for Hedera Wallet Snap and an example website that integrates the snap to offer various features such as sending HBAR to another HBAR account id and EVM address, retrieving account info from either the Hedera Ledger node or Hedera Mirror node.
